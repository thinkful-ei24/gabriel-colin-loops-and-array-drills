Question 1:

Scope defines where a variable is accessible.  A variable in global scope can be accessed anywhere in a file as well as across files.  Local scope can only be accessed within the immediate block of code that it is declared.  

Question2 :

Global variables are avoided because they are prone to side effects and mutations due to the nature of them being accessible from anywhere in the file. 

Question 3:

Strict mode is an ES5 feature that forces errors to be thrown if variables are not declared using let or const. It also prevents the redeclaration of global variables.

Question 4:

A side effect is any inintended output of a function or program.  A pure function produces the same output if given the same input.
